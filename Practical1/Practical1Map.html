    <h1> High-speed Rail Network in Windsor-Quebec City Corridor </h1>
    
    <h2> High-speed Rail Network Overview </h2>
    
    <p> The network would span around 1200km, making it the longest highspeed rail network in North America once completed. The network would take 15 years to fully construct and cost about $12.8 million CAD (2009) per kilometer, which is on the low end of cost per kilometer when compared to other international highspeed rail projects. The reason for this is most of the land along the route is suitable for construction and there is no need to bore tunnels. Once the network is fully operational it is projected to attract 11.1 million passengers and generate $1.3 billion CAD (2009) in revenue. </p>
    
    <h2> The Rail Technology </h2>
    
    <p> The highspeed rail network would consists of electric powered trains which can reach a maximum travelling speed of 300 km/h and hold up to 400 passengers. Since the trains are powered from electricity, they would be like a streetcar, with the need of overheard wires that conduct the electricity to the train. The use of an electric power source is preferable because they emit less noise at low speeds, only depend on fossil fuels if the power source is from a thermal power plant and have minimal amount of flammable fluids on board. The one main draw back is the high initial investment cost due to the development of an electric power source. </p>
    
    <h2> Proposed Windsor-Quebec City Corridor High-Speed Rail Network </h2>
    <div id="map"></div>
    
    <h2> Population </h2> 
    
    <p> Around 18 million people live in the Windsor-Quebec City corridor, that is around half of Canada’s population. The network would connect some of Canada’s most important and biggest cities to each other. Furthermore, the network could be extended in Windsor to connect Detroit and in Montreal to connect New York City to the network. </p>
    
    <h2> Travel Time</h2>

    <p> Travel time between all major cities along the network were calculated. These travel times would be competitive with air services, and much faster than automobile and existing VIA Rail service. In addition, there would be three shuttles within the network. These shuttles being Windsor to Toronto, Toronto to Montreal and Montreal to Quebec City. That means a train makes all stops within a shuttle but once it gets to a end city of the shuttle it turns around. Therefore, if a passenger were to travel along the whole network, from Windsor to Quebec City, they would have to transfer trains three times. </p>
